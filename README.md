# Stackable modal

Stackable modals is a library for modal dialogs which can be infinitely stacked. 
The component uses bootstrap for styling the modal but DOES NOT include it by default - 
you need to import it yourself.

When you open a second dialog the first one is scaled to 0.9 and position behind
